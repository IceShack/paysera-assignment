# Paysera Assignment
I created this project with the given requirements. One issue I ran into, was that https://lookup.binlist.net/ doesn't work without an API key anymore. So I couldn't really test it with real life data.

## Installation
- Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:IceShack/paysera-assignment.git`
- Install packages `composer install`
- Run the command `bin/console --env=prod input.txt`

## PHPUnit
- Run `bin/phpunit`
